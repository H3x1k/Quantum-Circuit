Quantum Circuit Framework (C++)

A lightweight C++ framework for building, simulating, and visualizing quantum circuits directly in the command line. Easily create custom gates and experiment with quantum algorithms.

Features
	•	Circuit Construction: Build quantum circuits programmatically with qubits, gates, and measurements.
	•	Custom Gates: Define and use your own quantum gates.
	•	Command-Line Visualization: View circuit layouts and gate operations directly in the terminal.
	•	Lightweight and Extensible: Designed for easy integration and extension for research or learning.
